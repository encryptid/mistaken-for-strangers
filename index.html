                <p>You have to do it running</p>
                <p>But you do everything that they ask you to</p>
                <p>'Cause you don't mind seeing yourself in a picture</p>
                <p>As long as you look faraway, as long as you look removed</p>

                <p>You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends</p>
                <p>When you pass them at night</p>
                <p>Under the silvery, silvery Citibank lights</p>
                <p>Arm in arm in arm and eyes and eyes, glazing under</p>

                <p>Surprise, surprise, they wouldn't wanna watch</p>
                <p>Another un-innocent, elegant fall</p>
                <p>Into the un-magnificent lives of adults</p>

                <p>Make up something to believe in your heart of hearts</p>
                <p>So you have something to wear on your sleeve of sleeves</p>
                <p>So you swear, you just saw a feathery woman</p>
                <p>Carry a blindfolded man through the trees</p>

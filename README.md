# Mistaken For Strangers

<h2>A project based on the song "Mistaken For Strangers" by the National</h2>
<p>I had the idea that it might be a fun way to play around with some ideas to turn some of my favorite songs into websites that convey the feel of a song. Kind of like a scrapbook. I had some rough ideas and I thought I'd commit them for fun.</p>

<ul>So far, the tech stack is just:
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>Sass</li>
<li>That's pretty much it</li></ul>

<ul>I'd like to make it a special point to include:
<li>CSS Grid, if it makes sense. I'm on a grid kick.</li>
<li>Transitions & some tasteful, understated animation in vanilla CSS and JS</li>
<li>Other stuff. If you're reading this, make a suggestion!</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll see how it goes!</p>
